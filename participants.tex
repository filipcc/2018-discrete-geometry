Tell us what type of math you have studied so far, where you did that, what you would like to learn from this course, what passions you have for the future, and anything else about you that you'd like to share

\section*{VÃ­ctor Ruiz Herrero}
(rufyzos)

I  have  studied  maths  in  FME,  I  would  like  to  learn  a  lot  of  geometry  in  this course and in the future I would like to be a doctor in Mathematics.

\section*{Esteve Tarrago Sanchis}
(tarragoesteve)

I  studied computer science and industrial engineering at UPC. There we study some discrete and applied math. I would like to learn more about geometry, and in particular those structures useful to model real-world. One topic that I may focus on the future is reinforcement learning applied on to robots policies.
