I have studied a degree in Telecommunications Engineering for the last 4 years here in Barcelona, at UPC. This course, I would like to study computation-related topics and code a little bit! I'm not sure what to do in a near future, but I have some ideas as an entrepreneur. Looking forward to enjoy this course!
